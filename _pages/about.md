I am a PhD researcher (FWO Fellow) in the [COSIC](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/) group at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), under the supervision of professor Ingrid Verbauwhede.
My interests include microarchitectural attacks and defenses, as well as efficient and secure cryptographic implementations.
During the summer of 2022, I interned at Intel Labs.
I will graduate mid-2023.
